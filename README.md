# Flight-Reservation-System_DBMS-Project
##  Project Introduction

The **Flight Reservation System** simulates a simplified airline ticket booking system where users can execute raw SQL queries and interact with backend data such as flights, passengers, bookings, and payments. This system is designed specifically for academic purposes to demonstrate practical database modeling, normalization, and SQL query execution through a web-based interface.

---

##  Project Overview

This project allows users to input custom SQL queries via a user-friendly web interface and view real-time results. It includes features like flight management, booking records, and payment tracking — all handled through a relational database. The interface includes a light/dark theme toggle and modern UI elements built using CSS and Bootstrap. This project is fully dynamic and serves as a hands-on learning tool for students studying relational databases and SQL.
