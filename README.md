# Flight-Reservation-System_DBMS-Project
##  Introduction

The **Flight Reservation System** simulates a simplified airline ticket booking system where users can execute raw SQL queries and interact with backend data such as flights, passengers, bookings, and payments. This system is designed specifically for academic purposes to demonstrate practical database modeling, normalization, and SQL query execution through a web-based interface.

---

##  Overview

This project allows users to input custom SQL queries via a user-friendly web interface and view real-time results. It includes features like flight management, booking records, and payment tracking ‚Äî all handled through a relational database. The interface includes a light/dark theme toggle and modern UI elements built using CSS and Bootstrap. This project is fully dynamic and serves as a hands-on learning tool for students studying relational databases and SQL.

##  Features

- Input and run raw SQL queries via form
- Display result of `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE` queries
- Passenger and flight management via booking table
- Dark and light mode switch
- Glowing and animated submit button
- Glassmorphic UI design with Bootstrap support
- Styled query result table with back-to-home option

üìù Notes

- This is a *solo project* developed by *Me*

- It serves both academic and learning purposes

- Useful for students practicing SQL, normalization, and PHP-MySQL integration

- Can be used as a base for DBMS practice or a mini admin system

üß† Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand database schema design, normalization (up to 3NF), relational query writing (JOIN, GROUP BY, Subquery), as well as frontend-backend integration using PHP and MySQL.
